    // NB. do NOT call this method directly, since it would be executed within the caller thread. To guarantee
    // that the VM lets the OS fork a new thread, the "start()" method of the Thread class must be called instead. Such
    // method is implemented to spawn a new thread and let it execute the code of the overridden "run()" method.
    // an instance of the Thread class is required, in the caller code, like the following:
    // Thread t = new Thread( theForker, Common.MonteCarlo.MonteCarloGenerator.UID() );
    // the first parameter is the instance of the class that implements Runnable;
    // the second parameter is the thread name. No unicity is required for the name, but it's very useful
    // to implement the unicity, for being able to recognize which thread is coming in action. As an example
    // I want to check-in every thread that comes to write in a Logging application, for the purpose of recognizing 
    // its stack, and so be able to know which functions such thread owns and deduce its indentment level.
