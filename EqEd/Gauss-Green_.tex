\section{Question to AI}
Good morning. Could You please show me the Green Gauss integration formula for a scalar field in the plane (x,y), f:(x,y)->z , f:R2->R, on a square chain [a,b]x[c,d] , f is C1 on R2


\section{Answer from AI}
%Good morning! Certainly, here is the Green-Gauss integration formula for the scalar field \( f(x, y) \) 
%defined in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) and \( C^1 \) on \( \mathbb{R}^2 \), applied to the square domain \([a,b] \times [c,d]\):

\[
\int_{a}^{b}\int_{c}^{d} \left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial y} \right) dx \, dy = \int_{\partial R} \big( P \, dx + Q \, dy \big)
\]

Where:
- \( R = [a,b] \times [c,d] \) is the square domain.
- \( \partial R \) is the closed boundary of \( R \), oriented positively (counterclockwise).
- \( P(x, y) \) and \( Q(x, y) \) are components of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} = (P, Q) \).

This formula essentially relates the integral of the divergence of \( \mathbf{F} \) over \( R \) to the line integral of \( \mathbf{F} \) along the boundary \( \partial R \). In your case, the scalar field \( f(x,y) \) can be substituted appropriately into the formula to analyze its behavior on the given domain.

Let me know if youâ€™d like further clarification or examples!
