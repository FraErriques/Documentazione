	\section*{Differential Forms as Totally Antisymmetric Tensors of Type \((0, r)\)}
	
	\subsection*{What Is a Tensor of Type \((0, r)\)?}
	
	A tensor of type \((0, r)\) on a smooth manifold \( M \) is a multilinear map:
	\[
	T: \underbrace{T_pM \times \cdots \times T_pM}_{r \text{ times}} \to \mathbb{R}
	\]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Here, \( T_pM \) is the tangent space at a point \( p \in M \).
		\item The tensor takes \( r \) tangent vectors and returns a real number.
		\item This is also called a \textbf{covariant tensor of rank \( r \)}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{What Does ``Totally Antisymmetric'' Mean?}
	
	A tensor \( \omega \) is \textbf{totally antisymmetric} if swapping any two of its arguments changes the sign of the output:
	\[
	\omega(v_1, \dots, v_i, \dots, v_j, \dots, v_r) = -\omega(v_1, \dots, v_j, \dots, v_i, \dots, v_r)
	\]
	for all \( i \neq j \). If two arguments are equal, the form evaluates to zero.
	
	This antisymmetry is the defining feature of \textbf{differential forms}.
	
	\subsection*{So What Is a Differential Form?}
	
	A \textbf{differential \( r \)-form} on a manifold \( M \) is a smooth assignment to each point \( p \in M \) of a totally antisymmetric tensor of type \((0, r)\) on \( T_pM \).
	
	In other words:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It’s a smooth section of the \textbf{exterior power} \( \Lambda^r T^*M \), the bundle of alternating \( r \)-covariant tensors.
		\item These forms can be added, multiplied via the \textbf{wedge product}, and differentiated using the \textbf{exterior derivative} \( d \).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Why Antisymmetry Matters}
	
	Antisymmetry gives differential forms their geometric and topological power:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It ensures that forms naturally integrate over oriented submanifolds.
		\item It leads to elegant identities like \textbf{Stokes' theorem}.
		\item It allows for coordinate-free expressions of physical laws (e.g., Maxwell’s equations in electrodynamics).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Example: A 2-Form}
	
	Let \( \omega \) be a 2-form on \( \mathbb{R}^3 \). In coordinates:
	\[
	\omega = f(x, y, z)\, dx \wedge dy + g(x, y, z)\, dy \wedge dz + h(x, y, z)\, dz \wedge dx
	\]
	This is a totally antisymmetric 2-tensor: swapping \( dx \) and \( dy \) flips the sign of the term.
